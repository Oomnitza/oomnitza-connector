#### * Python2 Deprecation Notice:
Since version **2.1.0** the connector is migrated to the python3.6.x (or above) codebase. 

The further maintenance, support and development of the python2 based version is NOT planned.

Please make sure you have converted ALL custom converters and filters to py3 syntax before upgrading the connector to the 2.1.0 or above.

# The Oomnitza Connector

## Getting Started
The Oomnitza Connector can be hosted on Oomnitza's
 server cloud, free of charge, if the third party server is
 or can be made accessible from the Oomnitza Cloud. Contact us for more details!
 Organizations with dedicated internal services may prefer to run this connector
 in-house, behind the same firewall that prevents outside access.

The most current version of this documentation can always be found on
 [GitHub](https://github.com/Oomnitza/oomnitza-connector/blob/master/README.md).

Since Oomnitza is highly customizable, there are many possibilities with the connector. Because of this, it is
 important to think ahead about what data you want to bring in and how you want to store it. Before we
 begin, take time to think about what information you want, and what Oomnitza fields you want filled out with data. 
 If the fields you want to map in haven’t been created yet, now is a good time to do so.
 (Refer to our [Guide to creating custom fields in Oomnitza](https://wiki.oomnitza.com/wiki/Creating_Fields_in_Oomnitza)
 to get started.)

## System Requirements
The Oomnitza Connector supports Linux, Windows, and Mac OS. 
For Linux, we recommend the Ubuntu OS.
Recommended Requirements: 2-4 vCPU, 4-8 GB RAM, 2 GB disk space. 
Overall the Connector has a small footprint and only utilizes CPU and 
RAM during the scheduled synchronization jobs. With log rotation enabled for 
the generated Connector logs, the consumed disk space will remain within limits. 
Depending on the number of integrations and volume of data, 
the Connector can be configured to use additional workers.

## Runtime Environment Setup
You will need to install Python 3.6.X (or above) as well as the packages which the connector
 relies upon. Some of the python packages may require build tools to be installed.

Please visit the sections below related to the build tools before installing the additional modules.

We suggest you setup a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
 and use `pip` to install the requirements. This can be done as follows (See our
 [documentation](https://wiki.oomnitza.com/wiki/Installing_additional_Python_Modules) on installing
 additional Python modules for use in Oomnitza.):

    cd /path/to/connector
    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

### Linux Environment
On Ubuntu, the build tools are installed using:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential unixodbc unixodbc-dev

### Windows Environment
For MS Windows you have to install Windows C++ compilers as build tools. Please visit the [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers)
 To check what is appropriate compiler you have to download and install. 


### OS X Environment
For OS X environment you have to install the build tools using the following command:

    xcode-select --install

## Connector Configs

Now you should be able to generate a default config file. Running `python connector.py generate-ini` will regenerate
 the `config.ini` file, and create a backup if the file already exists. When you edit this file, it will have one section
 per connection. You can safely remove the section for the connections you will not be using to keep the file small and
 manageable.

If you require multiple different configurations of a single connector, such as the need to pull from two different LDAP OUs,
 additional sections can be added by appending a '.' and a unique identifier to the section name. For example, having both a
 `[ldap]` and `[ldap.Contractors]` section will allow you to pull users from a default and Contractor OU.

An example generated `config.ini` follows.

The `[oomnitza]` section is where you configure the connector with the URL and login credentials for connecting to
Oomnitza. You can use an existing user’s credentials for username and password, but best practice is to create a
service account using your standard naming convention. (See the (documentation)[http://docs)
for managing user accounts in Oomnitza.)

The remaining sections each deal with a single connection to an external service. The "enable" field is common to all
connections and if set to "True" will enable this service for processing. Some fields are common to a type of
connection. For example, "default_role" and "default_user" are fields for connections dealing with loading
People into the Oomnitza app.

Each section can end with a list of field mappings. Simple mappings which just copy a field from the external system to
 a field inside Oomnitza can be defined here or in the System Settings within Oomnitza. Simple mappings are as follows:

    mapping.[Oomnitza Field] = {"source": "[external field]"}

For fields which require processing before being brought into Oomnitza must be defined in the INI. These mappings are
 more involved. Please contact [support@oomnitza.com](mailto://support@oomnitza.com) for more information. The format is:

    mapping.[Oomnitza Field] = {"source": "[external field]", "converter": "[converter name]"}

### Common optional settings
`sync_field`: The Oomnitza field (fields) which contains the object's unique identifier. 
We typically recommend username or email for users and serial_number for assets.
Will be loaded from Oomnitza mapping if not set. To create multiple sync field, split it by comma,
for example `sync_field = USER,EMAIL`.
The exceptions for this rule are the LDAP assets & CSV files because there is no way to
set the mapping in Oomnitza for these data sources at the current moment.

`insert_only`: set this to True to only create records in Oomnitza. Records for existing objects will not be updated.

`update_only`: set this to True to only update records in Oomnitza. Records for new objects will not be created.

`insert_only` and `update_only` can not be both of true value.

`verify_ssl`: set to false if the target data source instance is running with a self signed or invalid SSL certificate.

`ssl_protocol` : if the service to be connected to requires a particular SSL protocol version to properly connect, the connection's
 section in the ini file can include a `ssl_protocol` option. The value can be one of:
 `ssl`, `sslv23`, `sslv3`, `tls`, `tls1`.

### Oomnitza Configuration
`url`: the url of the Oomnitza application. For example: `https://example.oomnitza.com`

`username`: the Oomnitza username to use

`password`: the Oomnitza password to use

`api_token`: The API Token belonging to the Oomnitza user. If provided, `username` and `password` will not be used.

`user_pem_file`: The path to the PEM-encoded certificate containing the both private and public keys of the user. 
Has to be used **_only_** if there is enabled two factor authentication in your environment. The certificate has to be also uploaded to Oomnitza in the "Settings / Certificates" page.

## Storage for Connector secrets

To prevent secrets sprawl and disclosure the Oomnitza Connector uses secret backends to securely store credentials, usernames, API tokens, and passwords.

There are three options:

- local KeyRing;
- external Vault Key Management System by Hashicorp (the Vault KMS);
- external CyberArk Secrets Management

KeyRing (KeyChain) is a secure encrypted database and the easiest to configure.

The [Vault KMS](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/index.html) and [CyberArk](https://www.cyberark.com/products/privileged-account-security-solution/application-access-manager/) provide an
 additional layer of security. In this case, all secrets will be stored in the external encrypted system

### Common recommendations

Before adding secrets for Connector, first, follow the instructions and setup the Oomnitza Connector.
Use a technical role with restricted permissions to run the Connector.

### Deployment and receiving secrets

To add secrets use the command line utility which enables an easy way to
   place secrets to the system keyring service.

```sh
$ python strongbox.py --help
usage: strongbox.py [-h] [--version] --connector=CONNECTOR --key=KEY --value

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Show the vault version.
  --connector CONNECTOR Connector name or vault alias under which secret is saved in vault.
  --key KEY             Secret key name.
  --value VALUE         Secret value. Will be requested.
```

To prevent password disclosure you will be asked to provide your secret value
in the console.

You can add a few secrets to one type of Connector using the different `"key"`

Note the `CONNECTOR` name used in the argument `--connector` must be the same as the name of the section
used to describe the connector, or the same as the `vault_alias` set in the section within configuration file. For example, for the command

    python strongbox.py --connector=zendesk.abc --key=api_token --value=
    
we expect the section `[zendesk.abc]` exists in the configuration

    [zendesk.abc]
    enable = True
    ...
    
or the `vault_alias` was set within the section

    [zendesk]
    vault_alias = zendesk.abc
    enable = True
    ...

There is no validation set for the alias and the section name clash. If both found the alias has the priority.
Another thing to be mentioned is that the `vault_alias` can be any string value and not be relevant to the name of the service it relates to.  
It is OK to set the `vault_alias = I_love_cats` or any other value you want.

#### Local KeyRing

OS Supported:

Ubuntu Linux: [SecretStorage](https://github.com/mitya57/secretstorage) (requires installation of additional packages).

Windows: Windows Credential Manager (by default).

OS X: KeyChain. The encryption is AES 128 in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).

_OS X Note: the `keyring==8.7` tested on Mac OS X 10.12.6._

1. To use local KeyRing specify `keyring` as the `vault_backend` in config

```ini
[oomnitza]
url = https://example.com
vault_backend = keyring
vault_keys = api_token
```

For Linux, you may have to install **dbus-python** package and configure KeyRing Daemon.

2. Add the secrets:

```sh
python strongbox.py --connector=oomnitza --key=api_token --value=
Your secret: your-secret
```

#### HashiCorp Vault

To use the Vault KMS:

1. Install, initialize and unseal the Vault KMS (use documentation).

2. Mount Key/Value Secret Backend.

3. Write secrets to Key/Value Secret Backend. For example:

```sh
$ vault write secret/zendesk \
    system_name=oomnitza_user \
    api_token=123456789ABCD$$$
Success! Data written to: secret/zendesk
```
4. Create a json/hcl file with policy:

This section grants all access on __"*secret/zendesk**"__. 
Further restrictions can be applied to this broad policy.

```hcl
path "secret/zendesk/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

5. To add this policy to the Vault KMS system policies list use the following
   command or API:

```sh
vault write sys/policy/zendesk-read policy=@/root/vault/zendesk-read.hcl
```

6. To create a token with assigned policy:

```sh
vault token-create -policy=zendesk-read -policy=zendesk-read -policy=logs
Token: 6c1247-413f-4816-5f=a72-2ertc1d2165e
```

7. To use Hashicorp Vault as a secret backend set "vault_backend = vault" instead of "keyring".

```ini
[zendesk]
enable = true
url = https://example.com
vault_backend = vault
vault_keys = api_token username password
```

8. To connect to the Hashicorp Vault the `vault_url` and `vault_token` should
   be added to system keyring via vault cli.

Use `strongbox.py` cli to add `vault_url` and `vault_token` to system keyring

```sh
python strongbox.py --connector=zendesk --key=vault_url --value=
Your secret: https://vault.adress.com/v1/secret/zendesk

python strongbox.py --connector=zendesk --key=vault_token --value=
Your secret: 6c1247-413f-4816-5f=a72-2ertc1d2165e
```

__It is recomended to use read-only token.__

#### CyberArk secret storage

In order to use CyberArk as secret storage:

1. Install and configure CyberArk storage (use self-hosted storage or use
   dedicated storage provided by [CyberArk](https://www.cyberark.com/))

2. Write secrets to CyberArk storage

3. Configure connector to use CyberArk secret backend

##### Self-hosted CyberArk installation

- Use [official documentation](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Get%20Started/install-open-source.htm) to install and configure CyberArk Conjur service

    ```
    # In your terminal, download the Conjur Open Source quick-start configuration
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://www.conjur.org/get-started/docker-compose.quickstart.yml

    # Pull all of the required Docker images from DockerHub.
    docker-compose pull

    # Generate a master data key:
    docker-compose run --no-deps --rm conjur data-key generate > data_key

    # Load the data key into the environment:
    export CONJUR_DATA_KEY="$(< data_key)"

    # Run the Conjur server, database, and client:
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    If you want to confirm that CyberArk was installed properly, you can open a
    browser and go to localhost:8080 and view the included status UI page.

- Create new account (name should be equal to your connector configration
    section)

    ```
    docker-compose exec conjur conjurctl account create zendesk
    # API key for admin: <cyberark_api_key>
    ```

- Start a bash shell for the Conjur client CLI

    ```
    docker-compose exec client bash
    ```

- Login into your account

    ```
    conjur init -u conjur -a zendesk
    conjur authn login -u admin
    ```

- Create root policy, e.g. [use more complex / nested configuration for
  granular permissions](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Operations/Policy/PolicyGuideConcepts%20and%20Best%20Practices%20_%20Conjur%20Developer%20Docs.html)

    ```
    $ cat /root/policy/zendesk-policy.yml

    ---
    - !variable api_token
    - !variable some_secret_key
    ```

- Apply policy to your account (this allow you manage the specified secrets
    via command line or api)

    ```
    conjur policy load root /root/policy/zendesk-policy.yml
    ```

##### Managing secrets via CyberArk

- Push all required secrets into storage

    ```
    conjur variable values add api_token secret-api-token
    conjur variable values add some_secret_key some-secret-value
    ```

##### Connector configuration

- To connect to the CyberArk secret storage - the `vault_url` and `vault_token` should
  be added to system keyring via cli.

Use `strongbox.py` cli to add `vault_url` and `vault_token` to system keyring

```sh
python strongbox.py --connector=zendesk --key=vault_url --value=
Your secret: https://cyberark-secret-storage-sever.example.com

python strongbox.py --connector=zendesk --key=vault_token --value=
Your secret: <cyberark_api_key>
```

- Update connector configuration to use CyberArk secret storage

```ini
[zendesk]
enable = true
url = https://example.com
vault_backend = cyberark
vault_keys = api_token some_secret_key
```

## Running the connector server
It is possible to setup the connector server that will handle webhooks and other requests from external sources and react to them. 
The connector server is [WSGI compliant server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface).
The connector server is meant to be run from the command line with following command line arguments:

    $ python server.py -h
    usage: server.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                     [--show-mappings] [--testmode] [--save-data] [--ini INI]
                     [--logging-config LOGGING_CONFIG]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --host HOST
      --port PORT
      --show-mappings       Show the mappings which would be used by the
                            connector.
      --testmode            Run connectors in test mode.
      --save-data           Saves the data loaded from other system.
      --ini INI             Config file to use.
      --logging-config LOGGING_CONFIG
                            Use to override logging config file to use.

The available arguments for the connector server are serving for the same purposes as for the connector client, except 2 new server-specific arguments:

`--host` is used to specify the server's host. Default is 127.0.0.1

`--port` is used to specify the server's port. Default is 8000

The url pointing to the connector server instance should ends with the name of the connector:

Examples:

    https://my-connector-server.com/it/does/not/matter/casper
    https://my-connector-server.com/it/does/not/matter/casper.MDM
    https://my-connector-server.com/it/does/not/matter/casper.1

**Note:** Now only the Casper (JAMF Pro) Webhooks are supported out of the box by the connector server.
First you have to enable webhooks with JSON payloads (http://docs.jamf.com/9.96/casper-suite/administrator-guide/Webhooks.html)
Out of the box the following webhooks are supported:
 
* ComputerAdded
* ComputerCheckIn
* ComputerInventoryCompleted
* ComputerPolicyFinished
* ComputerPushCapabilityChanged
* MobileDeviceCheckIn
* MobileDeviceCommandCompleted
* MobileDeviceEnrolled
* MobileDevicePushSent
* MobileDeviceUnEnrolled

As soon as the connector server is receiving the message from the Casper (JAMF Pro) it is initiating the request to fetch the details of the asset triggered that webhook request and sync it with Oomnitza. 
This allows efficiently and fast keep the Oomnitza in the up-to-date state.

Also please keep in mind that the webhooks from the Casper (JAMF Pro) **do not add any authorization information** in the requests to the connector server. 
Because of that server cannot verify incoming requests in any way, so if you want somehow forbid access to the connector's server interface configured to listen to Casper (JAMF Pro) webhooks, 
you have to use something else, like firewalls with configured allowed IPs, etc.

## Running the connector client
The connector is meant to be run from the command line and as such as multiple command line options:

    $ python connector.py -h
    usage: connector.py [-h] [--record-count RECORD_COUNT] [--workers WORKERS]
                        [--show-mappings] [--testmode] [--save-data] [--ini INI]
                        [--logging-config LOGGING_CONFIG]
                        [--ignore-cloud-maintenance]
                        [{managed,upload,generate-ini,version}]
                        [connectors [connectors ...]]
    
    positional arguments:
      {version,generate-ini,upload,managed}
                            Action to perform.
      connectors            Connectors to run. Relevant only for the `upload` mode
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --record-count RECORD_COUNT
                            Number of records to pull and process from connection.
                            Relevant only for the `upload` mode
      --workers WORKERS     Number of async IO workers used to pull & push
                            records.
      --ignore-cloud-maintenance
                            Adds special behavior for the managed connectors to
                            ignore the cloud maintenance
      --show-mappings       Show the mappings which would be used by the
                            connector. Relevant only for the `upload` mode
      --testmode            Run connectors in test mode.
      --save-data           Saves the data loaded from other system.
      --ini INI             Config file to use.
      --logging-config LOGGING_CONFIG
                            Use to override logging config file to use.

The available actions are:

* `version`: shows the version of the connector and exit
* `managed`: the default mode for the connector, starts the connector in the "managed-from-cloud" mode, when the configuration, mapping, etc are retrieved from the Oomnitza cloud. Requires to have
only the `[oomnitza]` section to be configured within the .ini file to operate
* `generate-ini`: generate an example `config.ini` file.
* `upload`: uploads the data from the indicated connectors to Oomnitza. The connector values are taken
   from the section names in the ini file.

`--ini` is used to specify which config file to load, if not provided, `config.ini` from the root directory will be used.
   This option can be used with the `generate-ini` action to specify the file to generate.

`--logging-config` is used to specify an alternate logging config file.

`--show-mappings` is used to print out the loaded mappings. These mappings can be a combination of the built-in mappings,
   `config.ini` mappings, and mappings setup via the website.

`--testmode` will print out the records which would have been sent rather than pushing the data to the server. This
   can be used to see what, exactly, is getting sent to the server.

`--record-count` is used to limit the number of records to process. Once this number have been processed, the connector
   will exit. This can be used with `--testmode` to print out a limited number of records then exit cleanly.

`--save-data` is used to save the data loaded from the remote system to disk. These files can then be used to confirm
   the data is being loaded and mapped as expected.

`--workers` is used to setup the number of workers used to push the extracted data to Oomnitza instance. Default is 2. 
   If you will increase this value it will increase the load generated by connector and decrease the time required to finish the full sync.

`--ignore-cloud-maintenance` is used to specify the connector in the managed mode to ignore the cloud maintenance. If enabled the main loop will not be interrupted during the maintenance and the
 connector will continue to work 

### Setting the connector to run in managed mode

This is the main mode for the connector starting from the version 2.2.0

To run the connector in the `managed` mode you have to start it using any of these two commands

    python connector.py managed
    python connector.py

The `managed` mode is used to run the connector configuration stored in the Oomnitza cloud. In the `managed` mode the schedule/mapping and other parameters are 
configured within the Oomnitza cloud and normally the only reason to use the `managed` connector for the on-premise installation is the willing of own local secret storage usage.

In order to configure the managed connector you have to create a new section in the configuration .ini file. The name of the seiction is the concatenation of two strings:
- `managed`
- the ID of the integration in Oomnitza cloud (visible in the Web UI on the integration configuration details page)

For example, for the configuration with ID = 67, the section must be named as `managed.67`

This section must contain two items:
`saas_authorization`: the JSON specified dictionary with the ready-to-use HTTP headers and/or query params used for the authorization in the external data source API.
The structure of the JSON is the following:
    
    {"headers": <dictionary with the key-value specification of headers>, "params": <dictionary with the key-value specification of headers>}
    
The `headers` or `params` or both must be set. Examples:

Imagine the system, where the special authorization token `XYZ` must be passed as the header named `authorization` or as the query parameter with the same name

    {"headers": {"authorization": "XYZ"}}                   # OK
    {"headers": {"authorization": "XYZ"}, "params": {}}     # OK
    {"params": {"authorization": "XYZ"}}                    # OK
    {"params": {"authorization": "XYZ"}, "headers": {}}     # OK
    
    {"params": {}, "headers": {}}      # NOT OK - headers and params not set

The exception from this rule is the session-based auth scenarios where the headers and params cannot be defined initially and will be generated dynamically

`oomnitza_authorization`: Optional. The Oomnitza API token of user on behalf of who the connector sync will be triggered and all the changes wil lbe brought. Can be just not set. If not set the same
 user as defined in the `[oomnitza]` section will be used

`local_inputs`: Optional. The alternate additional storage for the inputs to be used instead of ones coming from the cloud. Must be used only if the integration
requires some extra secrets filled in in Oomnitza WebUI but you want to keep these secrets locally.

Example #1: the config.ini file for the stored integration with ID = 67 and auth header `Authorization: Bearer ABC`:
 
    [oomnitza]
    url = https://example.oomnitza.com
    api_token = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_1

    [managed.67]
    oomnitza_authorization = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_2
    saas_authorization = {"headers": {"Authorizaton": "Bearer ABC"}}

Example #2: the config.ini file for the stored integration with ID = 15 and session-based auth flow where all the required inputs are stored in the Oomnitza cloud:

    [oomnitza]
    url = https://example.oomnitza.com
    api_token = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_1

    [managed.15]
    oomnitza_authorization = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_2

Example #2: the config.ini file for the stored integration with ID = 34 and session-based auth flow where all the required inputs are stored locally:

    [oomnitza]
    url = https://example.oomnitza.com
    api_token = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_1

    [managed.34]
    oomnitza_authorization = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_2
    local_inputs = {"username": "john.smith", "password": "supErs3cr3T"}


#### Setting the export file connector

"Export file" connector is the subset of the managed connectors. The main difference between the "export file" connector and all the other connectors is that 
it works in an reverse mode - it fetches the data from Oomnitza, not brings data to it. The result of sync of the "export file" connector is the .CSV file with the
data from Oomnitza (assets or users).

The configuration for the managed connector is the same as as for the regular managed connectors except for 2 differences

1) The section name of the "export file" connector is named with the `managed_reports`, not `managed`
2) The section `managed_reports` does not need the `saas_authorization` to be set because there is no SaaS to deal with, we deal only with Oomnitza

The full example of the config.ini file for the stored "export file" integration with ID = 68 :

    [oomnitza]
    url = https://example.oomnitza.com
    api_token = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_1

    [managed_reports.68]
    oomnitza_authorization = i_am_oomnitza_api_token_2


### Setting the connector to run in upload mode

The mode `upload` is the main mode for the connector before version 2.2.0. In this mode the connector sync initiated from the client's side.

To run the connector in the `upload` mode you have to start it like this:

    python connector.py upload <data_source_1> <data_source_2> ...

The specified name of the data source (`<data_source_1>`, ...) must match the name of the section within configuration .ini file
Within this section there must be `enable = True` set explicitly

#### Setting the connector to run as an automated task for upload mode
There are many ways to automate the sync, here are a few:

    No default mappings


#### Chef Configuration
The `[chef]` section contains a similar set of preferences.

The identifier section of the `config.ini` file should contain a mapping to a unique field in Oomnitza, which you want to use as the identifier for an asset.

`url`: the full url of the Chef server with organization e.g. https://chef-server/organizations/ORG/

`client`: the Chef username for authentication

`key_file`: the Chef RSA private key for authentication

`attribute_extension`: [optional] dictionary of additional node attributes to extract

##### List of currently supported Chef attributes
    'hardware.name'
    'hardware.ip_address'
    'hardware.mac_address'
    'hardware.hostname'
    'hardware.fqdn'
    'hardware.domain'

    'hardware.total_memory_mb'
    'hardware.total_hdd_mb'
    'hardware.cpu'
    'hardware'cpu_count'
    'hardware.uptime_seconds'

##### Attribute Extension
The connector `config.ini` allows for additional node attributes to be extracted.

Example: `attribute_extension = {"__default__": {"kernel_name": "automatic.kernel.name"}}`

The above example will introduce a new mappable attribute "hardware.kernel_name". If a particular platform does not have this node attribute, it will processed as empty.

`attribute_extension = {
    "mac_os_x": {"machine_name": "automatic.machinename"},
    "windows": {"machine_name": "automatic.foo.bar"}
}`

The above example will introduce a new mappable attribute "hardware.machine_name" for mac_os_x and windows nodes only.

#### Google Chrome Devices

The following steps need to be taken to allow automated retrieval from Google Admin API:

 1) [Enable API access for your G Suite domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60757)
 2) Create a new project in [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and enable the Admin SDK.
 3) Create a service account in this project and delegate a domain-wide authority to it.  For more details, please refer to [Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) and follow the instructions.
The Oomnitza connector requires read-only API scope enable to successfully operate _`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.device.chromeos.readonly`_

The `[chromebooks]` section contains the following attributes:

`service_account_impersonate`: the email of the real G Suite administrator to be impersonated by the service account.

`service_account_json_key`: the content of the JSON key file generated for service account  **as one line**. This key is generated when you create the service account and also you can create additional keys later.

##### Default Field Mappings

    No default mappings. All mappings need to be defined in the config file.

#### Google Mobile Devices

NOTE: The Google mobile devices connector does not have a UI and must be configured using the config file.  The Google mobile devices management API reference with attributes description can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/mobiledevices).

The following steps need to be taken to allow automated retrieval from Google Admin API:

 1) [Enable API access for your G Suite domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60757)
 2) Create a new project in [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and enable the Admin SDK.
 3) Create a service account in this project and delegate a domain-wide authority to it.  For more details, please refer to [Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) and follow the instructions.
The Oomnitza connector requires read-only API scope enable to successfully operate _`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.device.mobile.readonly`_

## Advanced usage

### Logging
The Oomnitza Connector uses the standard python `logging` module. This modules is configured via the `logging.json` file.
 This file can be edited, or copied to a new file, to change the logging behavior of the connector. Please see the
 [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) for information of configuring python logging.

### Custom Converters
It is possible to create a completely custom complex converter that will be used to convert values extracted from external system to before pushing them to the Oomnitza.
 To use this option you have to define the name of this converter in the mapping, like this
    
    mapping.MY_AWESOME_FIELD =  {"source": "name", "converter": "my_custom_converter"}
 
 next you have to define new `[converters]` section in the config with the `my_custom_converter:`. Under this converter name you have to define a valid Python 3.6.X (or above) function,
 that has to return some value - this value is a result of the converter. In the converter function a "record" object is available, it is the whole record extracted from external system as Python [dict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict) object.
 Example:

    [ldap]
    
    ... here goes config ... 
    
    mapping.POSITION = {"source": "position", "converter": "my_custom_converter"}
    
    [converters]
    my_custom_converter:
        return record.get("position", "Unknown position")
 If an exception is raised inside the custom converter's code, a None value is returned as the result

### Record Filtering
Support has been added for filtering the records passed from the connector to Oomnitza. By default, all records from the
 remote system will be sent to Oomnitza for processing. To limit the records based on values in those records, a special
 `recordfilter` value can be added to a connector section in the ini file. This filter is written using the Python
 programming language.

For example, the following filter will only  process records with the `asset_type` field set to "`computer`":

    recordfilter:
        return record.asset_type == "computer"

This is a very new feature, with many options, and we are still working on the documentation. If you are interested in
 using this feature, please contact [support@oomnitza.com](mailto://support@oomnitza.com) for assistance.


## Current limitations

### Software mapping
There is no possibility to set the mapping for the software info associated with IT assets (SCCM, JAMF). The only thing can be done is to disable the mapping at all. 
To do this set the following custom mapping in your `config.ini` file:

    mapping.APPLICATIONS = {"hardcoded": []}

### MS Windows environment
In MS Windows environment the "Task Scheduler" is the natural tool to schedule the connector execution. Please note that in different version of Windows there can be different ways to specify the
 "working directory" of connector executable. One of the reliable way to solve this is to also set the path to the configuration files via the command line arguments.
